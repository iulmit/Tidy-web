# Tidy-web

The [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) is not regulated. In many ways, it's a wild-west. As it evolved, little care is taken for the reader, especially the press articles. Lot of ads, banners, pop-ups, forms (to subscribe for news, newsletter etc) and many other buzzware. Not to mention cookies, media buttons and links, trackers etc. Reading information on the internet is not so pleasant for the most part. We'd like to clean all this mess in a way which:
- information could be read easily
- ads are removed
- social-media links and buttons - removed
- trackers - removed
- user is warned before entering to malware websites, but still able to enter as safe as possible
- the above can be customized as options

To achieve this, we research and advise. Dedicated sections of tools which already work well are described. If planets align well, all these will be put together into a web browser extension/addon. Ultimately, browsing speed will increase, as well.

If using Windows, start with this:</br>

><sub>A footnote reference for myself to easily find help when editing markdown content: [GitHub](https://github.com/) combines a syntax for formatting text called [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) - an easy-to-read, easy-to-write syntax for formatting plain text. It even supports [Emoji](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md) :muscle:. I found a nice repository template for how to write a nice **README.md** file: [`ritaly / README-cheatsheet`](https://github.com/ritaly/README-cheatsheet), and a page having [many examples](https://github.github.com/gfm/) with side-by-side Markdown and HTML.</sub>
