# Internet-ReMiXed
A cleaner internet. Tools and documentation for helping a computer user to read and find information on the internet in a safe and clean way, as most internauts would want it to be.

The [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) is not regulated. In many ways, it's a wild-west. As it evolved, little care is taken for the reader, especially the press. Lot of ads, banners, pop-ups, forms (subscribe for news etc) and many other buzzware. Not to mention cookies, media buttons and links, trackers etc. We'd like to clean all this mess in a way which:
- read information easily
- remove ads
- remove social-media links and buttons
- remove trackers
- warn user of possible malware websites
- customize the above

To achieve this, we research and advise. Dedicated sections of tools which already work well are described. If planets align well, all these will be put together into a web browser extension/addon. Ultimately, browsing speed will increase, as well.

If using Windows, start with this:</br>

><sub>A footnote reference for myself to easily find help when editing markdown content: [GitHub](https://github.com/) combines a syntax for formatting text called [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) - an easy-to-read, easy-to-write syntax for formatting plain text. It even supports [Emoji](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md) :muscle:. I found a nice repository template for how to write a nice **README.md** file: [`ritaly / README-cheatsheet`](https://github.com/ritaly/README-cheatsheet), and a page having [many examples](https://github.github.com/gfm/) with side-by-side Markdown and HTML.</sub>
