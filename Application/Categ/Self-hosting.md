# Self-hosting apps (on-premises)

Useful applications which are hosted under user's control [on-premises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)) (as opposed to software [hosted in the Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) which runs on-demand).

For this, a [self-hosted infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)) is needed, and all responsability of data (including backup, security etc) are on the user's shoulders. This infrastructure can either be **physical** (bare-metal), **private cloud** (i.e. VMware ESXi, Oracle VirtualBox etc.) or **docker-based**. For storage only, it can even be as simple as **NAS** (i.e. Synology), and shared to the internet as FTP service (not the smartest choise due to security risks).
